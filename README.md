# Salesforce REST API Connectivity using Boomi

## Problem Statement
There can be several teams in an organization who need to connect to a Salesforce organization to get/send data. Salesforce Architects usually recommend to have separate users for separate projects so that the various access levels and roles can be segregated from a security standpoint.

## Limitation of Native Salesforce Connector
Suppose if there are 7 separate users created for Boomi integration in a Salesforce organization, and we decide to use Boomi's native/out-of-box Salesforce Connector, it will cost 7 licenses and the operational cost of Boomi would increase.
